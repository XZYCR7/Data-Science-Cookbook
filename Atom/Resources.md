## Interesting packages

- [Finally, an IDE that does both Python and R well (Atom)](https://jstaf.github.io/2018/03/25/atom-ide.html). I used this article to install Python and R on my MacBook Pro. It works.

Other resources I used for the above steps:

- [atom-ide-r](https://github.com/REditorSupport/atom-ide-r)
- [Atom gitlab-integration package]()
