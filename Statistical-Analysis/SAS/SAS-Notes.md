### How Do You Compute an R-square Statistic in GLM, GAMPL and GLIMMIX ?

For Generalized linear models and Generalized Additive models use the following SAS macro:
- [R-square and partial R-square for generalized linear models based on the variance function](http://support.sas.com/kb/60/162.html)
- For Generalized Linear Mixed Models there are two macros:
	- The two macros appears in book the book [_"Generalized Linear and Nonlinear Models for Correlated Data: Theory and Applications Using SAS"_](https://support.sas.com/en/books/authors/edward-vonesh.html).
	- Also read this article: [_Insights into Using the GLIMMIX Procedure to Model Categorical Outcomes with Random Effects_](https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/support/en/sas-global-forum-proceedings/2018/2179-2018.pdf).
