# Mixed Models

## Overview

Correlated data arise frequently in statistical analyses. This may be due to: 

- Grouping of subjects, e.g., students within classrooms, 
- or to repeated measurements on each subject over time or space, 
- or to multiple related outcome measures at one point in time. 

Mixed model analysis provides a general, flexible approach in these situations, because it allows a wide variety of correlation patterns (or variance-covariance structures) to be explicitly modeled.

Multiple measurements per subject generally result in the **correlated errors** that are explicitly forbidden by the assumptions of standard (between-subjects) AN(C)OVA and regression models.
