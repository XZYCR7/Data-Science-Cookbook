## Methodology Summary

### Interactive Grouping

- Interactive Grouping is used for two main tasks:
	- Perform univariate screening to eliminate weak characteristics or those that do not conform to good business logic.
	- Group the strongest characteristics (that is, create attribute levels) in order to produce a model in scorecard format.

- Grouping also offers a number of advantages:
	- Helps with dealing with outliers
	- Useful for understanding relationships
	- Enables modeling nonlinearities with a linear model

- For categorical variables, attributes with similar WOE values can be grouped together in accordance with business logic or regulatory requirements.
