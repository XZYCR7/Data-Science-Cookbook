## Methodology Summary

### Interactive Grouping

Interactive Grouping is used for two main tasks:
- Perform univariate screening to eliminate weak characteristics or those that do not conform to good business logic.
- Group the strongest characteristics (that is, create attribute levels) in order to produce a model in scorecard format.

Grouping also offers a number of advantages:
- Helps with dealing with outliers
- Useful for understanding relationships
- Enables modeling nonlinearities with a linear model
