Rodrigo's model deployment tools:

-   [HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/deploying-a-predictive-model-as-a-service-part-i/). It is also interesting but I am afraid that this is a cloud-based solution (Azure). At this point in time is not as good as Argo and ParallelM.
-   [Apache Airflow](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-apache-airflow-df1aa77d7b1b) quite similar to Argo
-   [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/)
