## RRDs using Spark 2.0+

- RDDs are schema-less structures that can help you handle both structured and unstructured data.
- RDDs are schema-less distributed collection of immutable JVM objects. They were available from the very beginning, since Matei Zaharia started working on Spark. Simplifying a little bit, similarly to how Hadoop works, RDDs chunk the data into partitions and each executor receives a portion of the data. In the next video, we will finally begin our hands-on sessions and we'll start creating RDDs, stay tuned and I'll see you there!
