### Computer Science Fundamentals and Programming

- **Data Structures**: stacks, queues, multi-dimensional arrays, trees, graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms**: searching, sorting, optimization, dynamic programming, etc.
- **Computability and complexity**: P vs. NP, NP-complete problems, big-O notation, approximate algorithms, etc.
- **Computer architecture**: memory, cache, bandwidth, deadlocks, distributed processing, etc.
