## Machine Learning Engineer Skills
- [5 Skills You Need to Become a Machine Learning Engineer](https://blog.udacity.com/2016/04/5-skills-you-need-to-become-a-machine-learning-engineer.html)
- [Career Comparison: Machine Learning Engineer vs. Data Scientistâ€”Who Does What?](https://www.springboard.com/blog/machine-learning-engineer-vs-data-scientist/)

### Computer Science Fundamentals and Programming

- **Data Structures**: stacks, queues, multi-dimensional arrays, trees, graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms**: searching, sorting, optimization, dynamic programming, etc.
- **Computability and complexity**: P vs. NP, NP-complete problems, big-O notation, approximate algorithms, etc.
- **Computer architecture**: memory, cache, bandwidth, deadlocks, distributed processing, etc.

Resources: the following resources are studied at CS undergraduate level. Therefor, the majority of CS masters assumes you already have them. For example [here](https://www.edx.org/masters/online-master-science-computer-science-utaustinx).
