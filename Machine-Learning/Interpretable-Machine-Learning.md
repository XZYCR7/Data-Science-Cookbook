# Interpretable Machine Learning Notes

*Notes about the book [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)*

## Preface

- Machine learning has great potential for improving products, processes and research. But **computers usually do not explain their predictions** which is a barrier to the adoption of machine learning.

- Interpretable models:
	- decision trees
	- linear regression
- General model-agnostic methods for **interpreting black box models** like: 
	- Feature importance and 
	- Accumulated local effects and 
	- Explaining individual predictions with Shapley values and LIME

All model-agnostic methods can be further differentiated based on whether they explain global model behavior across all data instances or individual predictions.

Methods explain the **overall behavior** of the model:

- Partial Dependence Plots
- 

The book focuses on machine learning models for tabular data (also called relational or structured data) and less on computer vision and natural language processing tasks.
