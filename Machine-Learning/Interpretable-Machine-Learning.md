# Interpretable Machine Learning Notes

*Notes about the book [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)*

## Preface

- Machine learning has great potential for improving products, processes and research. But **computers usually do not explain their predictions** which is a barrier to the adoption of machine learning.

- Interpretable models:
	- decision trees
	- linear regression
- General model-agnostic methods for **interpreting black box models** like: 
	- Feature importance and 
	- Accumulated local effects and 
	- Explaining individual predictions with Shapley values and LIME



The book focuses on machine learning models for tabular data (also called relational or structured data) and less on computer vision and natural language processing tasks.
