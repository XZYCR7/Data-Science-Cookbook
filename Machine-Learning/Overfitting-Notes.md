# Overfitting Notes

## Small Data problems

Problems of small-data are numerous, but mainly revolve around high variance:

-   **Over-fitting**  becomes much harder to avoid
-   You donâ€™t only over-fit to your training data, but sometimes you over-fit to your validation set as well.
-   **Outliers**  become much more dangerous.
-   Noise in general becomes a real issue, be it in your target variable or in some of the features.
