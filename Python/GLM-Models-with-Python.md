# GLM models in Python

## Different option to implement GLM models using Python
The following Python libraries provide GLM implementation using Python:
- scikit-learn
- h2o
- StatsModels
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- PySpark

### GLM with skikit-learn

- As at today you can only find there logistic and gaussian distributions implemented. 
- But really soon we are going to have the whole GLM family (Gamma, Poisson, Tweedie, etc.)
