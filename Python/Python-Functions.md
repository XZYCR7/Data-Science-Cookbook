Functions are an essential part of the Python programming language: you might have already encountered and used some of the many fantastic functions that are built-in in the Python language or that come with its library ecosystem. However, as a Data Scientist, you’ll constantly need to write your own functions to solve problems that your data poses to you.

That’s why this post will introduce you to functions in Python. You’ll cover the following topics:

## Functions in Python

You use functions in programming to bundle a set of instructions that you want to use repeatedly or that, because of their complexity, are better self-contained in a sub-program and called when needed. That means that a function is a piece of code written to carry out a specified task. To carry out that specific task, the function might or might not need multiple inputs. When the task is carried out, the function can or can not return one or more values.
